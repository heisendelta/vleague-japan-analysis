As you can see, the network here is more interconnected than the V League (possibly due to the difference in the numbers of teams). While the graph may seem complete, there are some teams that haven't played each other as of January 14 (such as *OSAKA* B vs. *TRshizuoka* or *VC NAGANO* vs. *SUNTORY*)
